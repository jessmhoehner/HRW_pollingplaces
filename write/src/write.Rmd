## How many polling places were open in 2016 as compared to 2020? 

```{r nplacesa, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

az_2016_df <- read_rds(files$az_2016_clean)
az_2020_df <- read_rds(files$az_2020_clean)

pct_delta_az <- round(sum((n_diff_az/as.numeric(nrow(az_2016_df))*100)),1)

# want to be able to change line 56 to say increase or decrease if data changes?

sc_2020_df <- read_rds(files$sc_2020_clean)

```

### Arizona
 In 2016, Arizona had `r nrow(az_2016_df)` open polling locations statewide. In
 2020 it had `r nrow(az_2020_df)` open polling locations. This is a difference 
 of `r n_diff_az` more or a `r pct_delta_az`% increase in polling locations.

### South Carolina
 In 2016, South Carolina had `r nrow(sc_2016_df)` open polling locations statewide. 
 In 2020 it had `r nrow(sc_2020_df)` open polling locations. This is a difference 
 of `r n_diff_sc` fewer or a `r pct_delta_sc`% decrease in polling locations.

### Arizona
 Between 2016 and 2020, `r az_table$count[1]` zip codes, or `r az_table$percent_of_zips[1]`% 
 of zip codes in Arizona with open polling locations in 2016 gained or maintained 
 the same number of open polling locations in 2020 while `r az_table$count[2]` 
 zip codes, or `r az_table$percent_of_zips[2]`%, lost polling places in 2020.

### South Carolina
 Between 2016 and 2020, `r sc_table$count[1]` zip codes, or `r sc_table$percent_of_zips[1]`% 
 of zip codes in South Carolina with open polling locations in 2016 gained or 
 maintained the same number of polling locations while `r sc_table$count[2]` 
 zip codes with open polling places in 2016, or `r sc_table$percent_of_zips[2]`%, 
 lost polling places in 2020.

### Arizona
 In zip codes which lost polling places in 2020,the average percentage of 
 people who considered themselves Hispanic or Latino as of the 2014-2018 
 American Community Survey was `r round_half_up(mean(az_demo_lost$percent_hl),2)`% with

 percentage of people who did not who consider themselves Hispanic or Latino was 
 `r round_half_up(mean(az_demo_lost$percent_not_hl),1)`% with a median of 
 `r round_half_up(median(az_demo_lost$percent_not_hl),2)`%.
 
  In zip codes which gained or maintained the same number polling locations in 
  2020, the average percentage of people who considered themselves Hispanic 
  or Latino was `r round_half_up(mean(az_demo_gm$percent_hl),2)`% with a median
